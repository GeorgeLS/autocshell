# autocshell

autocshell is a command line tool that enables you to generate shell files/scripts that you can use
in order to provide auto  completion capabilities for your command line programs.

This program is able to generate scripts for various shells (currently only bash and zsh) and not for c-shell only (not to be confused due to the name being  auto-**cshell**).

The only thing that autocshell requires is a simple to create configuration file that will take as input.
In order to check the configuration file format please run autocshell with the **--config-help** flag.

By default autocshell prints the script in the standard output so you can redirect the output to whatever file you like but by providing the **--output** option the program can do that for you :)

# Configuration File:

The configuration file that you must provide as input (using -c or --config option)
has the following format:

```
shell:        <shell_type> (bash|zsh)
program_name: <program_name>
use_equals_sign: (true|false) [default: true] (available only for zsh) 
option*:
    short?: <short_name> _
                          |-> At least one should exist
    long?:  <long_name>  â€¾
    accepts_value?:       (true|false) [default: true]  (available only for zsh)
    accepts_files?:       (true|false) [default: false]
    accepts_multiple?:    (true|false) [default: false] (available only for zsh)
    description?:
    fixed_values?:        [<fixed_value>, ...]
```

Field/Values explanation:

Field: shell\

Default: true\
Mandatory: no

Mandatory: no*

Field: long\
Value: The long option description (-- must be included)\

Mandatory: no

\* short and long fields are not mandatory, however if you define an option at least one of them must be present.

# Adding the completions to the shell

The recommended way to load and register the autocomplete functions for your programs is to create a folder where you will keep
all of the generated files in there. \
Then in you initialization shell script you can add the following: \
```
AUTOCOMPLETE_DIR=/path/to/dir
for f in$(find ${AUTOCOMPLETE_DIR} -name "*.<shell_name>");
do source $f;
done
```
Of course the loop might need to be tailored to the shell's acceptable syntax.

## Bash

For bash you don't need anything special to do, just source the files as shown above.

## Zsh

For zsh you **must** have run compinit, otherwise compdef will fail. \
If you are using oh-my-zsh that is done in .zshrc file, in the line oh-my-zsh.sh is sourced.
